    "## ⚠️ Model Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Historical Data Only\n",
    "- **Issue**: Clustering based on past ~3 years\n",
    "- **Impact**: Future risk may differ (market regime change)\n",
    "- **Mitigation**: Regularly retrain model, monitor drift\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. No Fundamental Analysis\n",
    "- **Issue**: Only uses price/volume technical data\n",
    "- **Missing**: Earnings, debt, management quality, competitive moat\n",
    "- **Impact**: Two stocks with similar technicals may have very different fundamentals\n",
    "- **Mitigation**: Use clustering as initial filter, then do fundamental analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Market Context Ignored\n",
    "- **Issue**: Doesn't account for overall market conditions\n",
    "- **Example**: Low-risk stock in bull market might be high-risk in crash\n",
    "- **Mitigation**: Add market regime detection, beta to market index\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Limited Sample Size\n",
    "- **Issue**: Only 57 NSE stocks (after filtering)\n",
    "- **Impact**: May not capture full risk spectrum\n",
    "- **Mitigation**: Include more stocks, use longer time periods\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. K-Means Assumptions\n",
    "- **Issue**: Assumes spherical clusters, equal variance\n",
    "- **Reality**: Risk profiles may have complex, non-spherical shapes\n",
    "- **Alternative**: Try DBSCAN, Hierarchical clustering, Gaussian Mixture Models\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Fixed Number of Clusters\n",
    "- **Issue**: Pre-defined 4 clusters (subjective choice)\n",
    "- **Impact**: Natural groupings might be 3 or 5 clusters\n",
    "- **Mitigation**: Test multiple K values, use domain expertise"
